item management system
*Project Question: Data Structure Management System*

*Objective*: Design and implement a management system that utilizes various data structures to organize and manipulate a collection of items.

### Requirements:

1. *Item Management*:
   - Each item should have a unique identifier, name, description, and category.
   - Implement functionality to add, view, update, and delete items.

2. *Data Structures*:
   - *Stack*: Use a stack to implement an "undo" feature for item deletions.
   - *Queue*: Implement a queue to manage items based on their priority (e.g., urgent, normal).
   - *Linked List*: Use a linked list to store items for efficient insertion and deletion.
   - *Binary Search Tree (BST)*: Implement a BST to categorize items by their unique identifiers, allowing for efficient searching and retrieval.

3. *User Interface*:
   - Create a console-based interface that allows users to interact with the system.
   - Provide options for adding, viewing, updating, deleting items, and managing priorities.

4. *add Features*:
   - Implement a search function to find items by name or category.
   - Allow users to save and load the item list from a file.

### Submission:
- Include source code with comments explaining the functionality of each part.
- Provide a short report detailing the design choices and data structure implementations.

### Deadline:
- 26/5/2025 at 11.59 PM
